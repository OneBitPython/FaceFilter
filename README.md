# FaceFilter

This is a project that I had made using the CV library. This project isn't to be taken seriously and was made just for fun. In short, the project applies different face filters for boys and girls

## How to setup the project

To setup the project, just download the repository, extract it and then run `pip install -r reqirements.txt` to install the required modules. Make sure you are in the same directory as the downloaded main.py file. Finally, run the main.py file by saying
`python main.py`

### boys

For boys it just adds in a mask, ~~I couldn't think of what else to do~~

### Girls

For girls, it adds some eye liner, some lipstick and some blush
